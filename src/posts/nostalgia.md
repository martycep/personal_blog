It’s a strange feeling to graduate in the same exact spot you left to start college, almost as if no time has passed by and everything’s been a dream. In a way, I’m reminded of the ending scene in Miyazaki’s Spirited Away when Chihiro wakes up and finds herself in the car that she and her parents were in during the opening scenes. 


I’m writing this in my sister’s old room in the house that I grew up in. My old room was passed down to my brother and my sister on the East Coast. Still, it feels as if I’m 18 again and I’m about to leave to go away. I guess that’s not entirely untrue. Instead of graduating from high school, I’m graduating from college and instead of moving to St. Louis, I’m hoping to move to New York City. 


But things aren’t entirely the same. 


I like to think that I’m much wiser now than before my time at Washington University. So much can and did happen in these four years. I explored and experienced in ways that I didn’t know were possible. It hasn’t been entirely great. I don’t think it ever was meant to be entirely great. But I’m grateful for my time there and the people that I’ve met there. 

Looking back at the person I was before college and the person I am now, I think they’re still the same people just with a difference of honesty. I’m now much more honest with myself and how the world is than I was before. This is a good and bad thing. Honesty breeds clarity but can cloud ambition.


I left this very same house four years ago vowing to make a fortune and become a successful tech billionaire or CEO. Now I don’t have that same hope. I have different values now. I have different priorities. While wealth is still in my equation for success, it’s much more balanced with ideas of health, happiness, and freedom. Perhaps seeing so many unhappy wealthy people at school made me realize that money may give the opportunity to happiness, but surely does not guarantee it. 


Despite my mindset being changed, there are still some things that haven’t changed since I left home and returned. For one, the loudness of the house remains the same. It’s never too quiet with this family. There’s an argument once a week, which is common among families and probably universal during these times of quarantine. Another is how the upper floor suffers from poor insulation during the afternoon and nobody turns on the AC except me. 


I’ll be turning 23 in July. 


But for some reason, I feel 19, on the precipice of great change and a new decade.
