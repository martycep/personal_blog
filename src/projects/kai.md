As part of Interaction Design at Washington University in St. Louis, we partnered up with a team of medical professionals, iCHASM - Investigators Connecting Health and Social Media, to design a digital experience for mothers that are recovering from opioid abuse.

The partnership was for 3 months and our role as a student design team was to design to inspire a medical team that was developing an app for the mothers.

Engineering feasibility was considered, but not the main focus. This was a speculative design project centered around finding the problems and giving ideal solutions. 

### Problem

Design a digital experience that helps mothers who are either pregnant or postpartum and recovering from opioid substance abuse.
