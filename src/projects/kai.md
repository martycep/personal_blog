As part of Interaction Design at Washington University in St. Louis, we partnered up with a team of medical professionals, iCHASM - Investigators Connecting Health and Social Media, to design a digital experience for mothers that are recovering from opioid abuse.

The partnership was for 3 months and our role as a student design team was to design to inspire a medical team that was developing an app for the mothers.

Engineering feasibility was considered, but not the main focus. This was a speculative design project centered around finding the problems and giving ideal solutions.

### Problem

Design a digital experience that helps mothers who are either pregnant or postpartum and recovering from opioid substance abuse.

### Solution

A smart wearable that connects patients with resources in the community and allows for more reliable communication with providers.

### Roles

Teammates: Anya Pawar, Maya Terry
Role: I was a generalist on the team contributing to the visual, interaction, and product designs of Kai. I also acted as the defacto product manager guiding feature roadmap and product goals throughout the process.
