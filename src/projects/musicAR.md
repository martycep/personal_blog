Is it possible to **see** music?

What colors and shapes would songs take?

It's an interesting question that many people have experimented with already.

In my senior year at Wash U, I took an iOS development class (CSE 438) and with a team of 5 made an app exploring audiovisual experiences using Augmented Reality and Spotify.

It was a fun project - learned a lot of Swift and got to practice MVC architecture.  I primarily helped out with the AR Objects, UI Design, and Audio Recording.

Below is a demo video. You can see the more formal code repo [here](https://bitbucket.org/Martin_Cepeda/musicar/src/master/).
