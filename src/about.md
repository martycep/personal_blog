say hi ðŸ‘‹: martinjcepeda [at] gmail [dot] com

for the professional ðŸ’¼

I recently graduated from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/) where I studied business, computer science, and design. Last summer, I was a fellow at [True Ventures](https://trueventures.com/) and worked on GTM, growth, and design for one of their companies, [Pendulum Therapeutics](https://pendulum.co/). 

I work best in situations where I have to adapt and learn on the go. That's why I like startups and interdisciplinary responsibiliites. I'm particularly interested in how we can responsibly build and think about long-term impact, not just short-run benefit. 

for the curious ðŸŒ±

I am a first-generation Filipino-American that grew up in agricultural Central California. I can recite the alphabet backwards. I'm receptively bilingual and working on becoming conversationally bilingual. 

I often think about the decoupling of work identity and personal identity. I suffer from an illicit preference for dairy while being lactose intolerant. 

I ask a lot of questions.
