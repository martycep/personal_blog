say hi ðŸ‘‹: martinjcepeda [at] gmail [dot] com

for the professional ðŸ’¼

I recently graduated from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/) where I studied business, computer science, and design. Last summer, I was a fellow at [True Ventures](https://trueventures.com/) and worked on GTM, growth, and design for one of their companies, [Pendulum Therapeutics](https://pendulum.co/). 

I've had a keen interest for startups choosing St. Louis as my home for 4 years because of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. I'm especially interested in seeing how we evolve our path to purchase systems through the blending of social and consumer experiences. 

for the curious ðŸŒ±

I am a first-generation Filipino-American that grew up in agricultural Central California. I can recite the alphabet backwards. I'm receptively bilingual and working on becoming conversationally bilingual. 

I often think about the decoupling of work identity and personal identity. I suffer from an illicit preference for dairy while being lactose intolerant. 

I ask a lot of questions.
